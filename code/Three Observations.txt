Three Observations
1. The tempature is the highest near the equator, well according to the data from one particular day. There is correlation.
2. Cloudiness and humidity doesn't seem to correlate with latitude.
3. Wind Speed might to have a minor correlation. While overall wind speed seem to stay consistently lower, but, on both sides of the equator, the further from the equator, exist more high wind speed cities.
