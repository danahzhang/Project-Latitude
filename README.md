# Project-Latitude

Introduction:
This project focused on observing possible correlation between latitude and various weatehr variables. By selecting a couple hundred random cities, and comparing the variables, we can prove (or disaprove) long held assumptions. Does the weather get hotter as we approach the equator? 

Data:
The data used can be explored on https://danahzhang.github.io/Project-Latitude/data.html.

Latitude:
The selection of the data is based on a randomized generated list. By using citipy, the code found the nearest cities, making the selection as a whole randomized.

Other Variables:
The city weather variables are gathered from the OpenWeatherAPI. 
Overall, there are four compariations:

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude


Website:
The website is created using Bootstrap.
